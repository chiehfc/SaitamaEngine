# SaitamaEngine

This is a game engine I just started recently to try learn every aspect in Game Programming.</br>
I chose DirectX11 as my Rendering API, started everything from scratch.</br>
It's definitely a WIP and will-not-be-done-soon project.</br>
</br>
Currently, it has a really simple Rendering structure with lighting using Scene Graph and event system.</br>
I also integrated Open Asset Import Library(ASSIMP) into my game engine so I can use fancy pikachu model.</br>
I'm starting adding Physics system into it and eventually AI system.</br>
I will probably recreate my own math library since I'm going to develop my own physics system.
My goal for this project is to create a simple FPS game using everything I create.</br>
I work on this in my spare time so the project may not be compiled sometime.</br>
</br>
Keep WORKING and LEARNING everyday :)</br>
